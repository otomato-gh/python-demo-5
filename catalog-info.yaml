    # informs where TechDocs source content is stored so that it can be read and docs can be generated from it. 
    # Most commonly, it's written as a path, relative to the location of the catalog-info.yaml itself, where the associated mkdocs.yml file can be found.
    # In unusual situations where the documentation for a catalog entity does not live alongside the entity's source code, the value of this annotation can point to an absolute URL, 
    # matching the location reference string format outlined above, for example: url:https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master
